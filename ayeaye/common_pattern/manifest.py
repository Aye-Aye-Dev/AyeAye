A manifest is "a list of people and goods carried on a ship or plane" but here, it's a list of
datasets.

A common pattern is to bootstrap a batched build by listing all the target files used in the build in a

    A manifest is a dataset containing a list of other datasets.

    It's common for an ETL model to transform or map each of these source datasets into a corresponding
    output dataset(s).

    :class:`AbstractManifestMapper` should be subclassed to act as a mapper between datasets in a
    manifest and output datasets. It is used to declare data connections within an :class:`ayeaye.Model`
    (i.e. the :class`ayeaye.Connect` class variables) and it's used within the model to provide
    maps of input to output datasets.

    For the manifest dataset, use a subclass of :class:`DataConnector` that supports dictionary
    access to `.data`. JSON is a good choice for the manifest dataset.

    Sub classes implement a method for each map and this method is either a generator or returns
    a list of (original_manifest_item, engine_url).

    For example, using xxxx as the map name:

    ```
    class FileMapper(AbstractManifestMapper):
        def map_xxxx(self):
            return [(f, f"json://{f}") for f in self.manifest_items]
    ```

    makes a method .xxxx() which returns just the engine_urls. It is used in an ayeaye.Connect-

    ```
    class AustralianAnimals(ayeaye.Model):
        animals_manifest = ayeaye.Connect(engine_url="json://{input_data}/animals_manifest.json")
        animals_mapper = FileMapper(animals_manifest)
        all_files = ayeaye.Connect(engine_url=animals_mapper.all_files) 
    ```

    And FileMapper will also be an iterator returning a object with attributes linking to the
    engine_urls of all mappers.

    For an example of how to use this see-
    https://github.com/Aye-Aye-Dev/AyeAye/blob/master/examples/manifest_mapper.py
