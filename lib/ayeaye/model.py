class PartitionedModel(Model):
    """
    Similar to :class:`Model` but requires additional methods to be implemented by the subclass to
    describe how the processing can be split into parallel subtasks.

    A model can suggest to the executor how many parallel tasks could be used and the executor
    is responsible for orchestrating a level of parallelisation that fits the execution environment.

    An external executor is expected to run :class:`PartitionedModel` subclasses. It would
    instantiate the model and examine it's :meth:`partition_plea` before running it in a
    distributed environment (e.g. Google Cloud Run, Celery, AWS' ECS etc.). The external executor
    is responsible for transporting task arguments, log message etc. TODO : there isn't an open
    source executor yet. It has been done in a commercial project.

    :class:`PartitionedModel` does support a simple mechanism for parallel execution across local
    processes. To use it implement the mandatory methods and run method:`go`.

    e.g.
    >>> my_model = MyModel()
    >>> my_model.go()

    And a reasonable number of local processes will run in a Python multiprocessor Pool to work
    on the tasks the model divides itself into.

    The executor is responsible for re-executing failed tasks. All sub-tasks should be idempotent and
    therefore safe to execute multiple times, possibly in parallel.

    It works as follows-

    1. The executor creates the parent instance. If the 'simple mechanism for parallel execution' (as
    above) is being used, this is the instance that :meth:`go` is running on.

    2. The executor asks the parent instance for 'suggestions' of how many sub-tasks the model can
    be split into (see :meth:`partition_plea`). This suggestion is for the number of workers the
    model would like to have running in parallel. There are situations where an exact number of
    workers are needed (e.g. so each worker has independent control of a resource such as a file)
    and there are other situations where too many worker could result in a stampede on a resource
    (such as a database).

    3. The executor evaluates the :class:`PartitionOption` returned by :meth:`partition_plea`
    along with the capabilities of the execution environment and requests a mutually compatible
    number of partition arguments from :meth:`partition_slice`. The number of sub-tasks doesn't
    need to match the number of workers although there can be a relationship.

    4. :meth:`partition_slice` is called on the parent instance. It returns a list of method
    names and sub-task arguments. Each of which is passed by the executor to an instance of the
    model that has been instantiated with the same resolver context (see :class:`ConnectorResolver`)
    as the 'parent' model. The models running in the worker processes are initiated when the worker
    process starts, i.e. each instance will have it's sub-task method called multiple times. See
    :meth:`partition_initialise`.

    4. The return value from each subtask is passed to optional :meth:`partition_subtask_complete`.

    5. When the executor is satisfied that all sub-tasks are complete the optional
    :meth:`partition_complete` method is called.

    6. The :meth:`build` will be called in a separate worker process. i.e. this isn't the same
    instance as the parent instance.
