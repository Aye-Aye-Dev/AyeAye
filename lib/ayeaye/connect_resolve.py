class ConnectorResolver:
    """
    Lazy substitution of template parameters.

    Normal usage of this module is for a single global instance to be available to all instances of
    all the subclasses of :class:`DataConnector`. This is provided as-

    >>> from ayeaye.connect_resolve import connector_resolver

    This instance is given a mapping (i.e. key value pairs in a dictionary) or it is given a
    `resolver_callable` that will be called only when needed. This call is most likely to be by a
    subclasses of DataConnector (i.e. connections to datasets) when they access the `engine_url`
    attribute.

    Example using named attributes-

    >>> import ayeaye
    >>> from ayeaye.connectors.csv_connector import CsvConnector
    >>> ayeaye.connect_resolve.connector_resolver.add(build_id="20210616A")
    >>> x = CsvConnector(engine_url="csv:///data/build_{build_id}/product_codes.csv")
    >>> x.engine_url
    'csv:///data/build_20210616A/product_codes.csv'
    >>>

    Example using a callable to resolve a secret:

    def my_env_resolver(unresolved_engine_url):
        '''finds params starting like '{env_xxx}' and replaces it with the content of the
        environmental variable 'xxx'
        '''
        # .... code not shown

    >>> import ayeaye
    >>> from ayeaye.connectors.sqlalchemy_database import SqlAlchemyDatabaseConnector
    >>> ayeaye.connect_resolve.connector_resolver.add_secret(my_env_resolver)
    >>> x = SqlAlchemyDatabaseConnector(engine_url="mysql://root:{env_secret_password}@localhost/my_database")
    >>> x.engine_url
    'mysql://root:p4ssw0rd@localhost/my_database'
    >>>
