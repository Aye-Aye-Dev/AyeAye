A manifest is "a list of people and goods carried on a ship or plane" but here, it's a list of
datasets.

A common pattern is to bootstrap a batched build by listing all the target files used in the build in a
manifest file. This manifest file is a dataset for any model that works on the target files.

    Make engine_urls stored in a manifest file available to :class:`ayeaye.Connector`s in an
    :class:`ayeaye.Model`.

    Each engine_url represents a specific version of a source dataset so this pattern can be
    used to create versioned ETL builds by storing versioning information in a manifest file.

    A manifest file is a dataset which can be retained to re-create ETL builds at a later date
    and to show data provenence.

    Creating the manifest file itself isn't expected to be a deterministic process as it probably
    takes a filesystem listing of available datasets and from this determines the most recent
    versions to use in the manifest file.

    Use a subclass of :class:`DataConnector` that supports dictionary access to `.data` as a
    manifest. Use this to build engine_url(s) for passing to another dataset within the
    dataset declarations part of an :class:`ayeaye.Model`.

    Tip: JSON is a good choice for the manifest dataset.

    The file `products_manifest_20210618.json` contains

class AbstractManifestMapper:
    """
    A manifest is a dataset containing a list of other datasets.

    It's common for an ETL model to transform or map each of these source datasets into a corresponding
    output dataset(s).

    :class:`AbstractManifestMapper` should be subclassed to act as a mapper between datasets in a
    manifest and output datasets. It is used to declare data connections within an :class:`ayeaye.Model`
    (i.e. the :class`ayeaye.Connect` class variables) and it's used within the model to provide
    maps of input to output datasets.

    For the manifest dataset, use a subclass of :class:`DataConnector` that supports dictionary
    access to `.data`. JSON is a good choice for the manifest dataset.

    Sub classes implement a method for each map and this method is either a generator or returns
    a list of (original_manifest_item, engine_url). [Note - this doesn't strictly need to be an
    engine_url if the mapper is used more generally and not just as a helper for ayeaye.Connect
    as is being demonstrated here].

    For example, using xxxx as the map name:

    ```
    class FileMapper(AbstractManifestMapper):
        def map_xxxx(self):
            return [(f, f"json://{f}") for f in self.manifest_items]
    ```

    creates a method `.xxxx()` which returns just the engine_urls. It is used in an ayeaye.Connect-

    ```
    class AustralianAnimals(ayeaye.Model):
        animals_manifest = ayeaye.Connect(engine_url="json://{input_data}/animals_manifest.json")
        animals_mapper = FileMapper(animals_manifest)
        all_files = ayeaye.Connect(engine_url=animals_mapper.all_files)
    ```

    And FileMapper will also be an iterator returning a object with attributes linking to the
    engine_urls of all mappers.

    For an example of how to use this see-
    https://github.com/Aye-Aye-Dev/AyeAye/blob/master/examples/manifest_mapper.py

    The tests in :class:`tests.common_pattern.test_manifest.TestManifest` also demonstrate usage.

    Notes-

    This class is a descriptor as it's expected to be used to declare class variables that are then
    used within the instance.

    If the subclass changes the constructor's arguments you must implement the __copy__ method.
